# Kuhn-Algorithm-Hungarian-algorithm-implementation

This is an implementation of kunh algorithme in Java. The Hungarian algorithm or Hungarian method, also called Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, is a combinatorial optimization algorithm, which solves the problem of assignment in polynomial time. It is thus an algorithm which makes it possible to find a perfect coupling of maximum weight in a bipartite graph whose edges are valued. Alternatively, it allows to find a perfect coupling of minimum weight in such a graph.



Implementation implemented as part of the graph theory course.
